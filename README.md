Generation Interim Project

In this short project, I explore the relationship between annual sick leave and job title in Microsoft's AdventureWorks test database. The project begins by connecting to the SQL server database and executing a SQL query to retrieve the relevant information into a pandas DataFrame. Once the data is loaded, I perform some basic overview methods to gain an understanding of the data, and then modify the data's structure slightly to allow for easier analysis. With prepared data, I perform an exploratory data analysis to explore relationships between variables and produce graphs using matplotlib and seaborn to present these relationships to stakeholders.
